# FAQs

#### Who is behind this campaign?

The COVID-19 tracker was created by several independent researchers in the CoronaMapsKW community.

#### What is the goal of the campaign?

The aim of the COVID-19 tracker is to collect as much data as possible as quickly as possible from both healthy and infected people in Kuwait. Among other things, this data is intended to provide a more detailed picture of the COVID-19 situation in different parts of our country.

#### How does data collection help fight the COVID-19 crisis?

This short-form helps predict and locate COVID-19 hotspots by evaluating how many people in the area have developed COVID-19 symptoms. Please fill out the form for each member of your home, including people who are feeling well and not showing any symptoms. . Comprehensive tests covering the whole country are not an option. Any additional information can, therefore, help to stop the virus from spreading.

#### Is the campaign scientifically supported?

The study has received ethical approval from the Ministry of Health (1451/2020). The campaign was developed by members of the scientific community with scientific rigor in mind. We employ approaches similar to other international studies concerning the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g. [COVID-19 Tracking Switzerland](https://www.covidtracker.ch/en/)).

#### What happens to my data?

The data collected using the COVID-19 tracker does not allow any conclusions to be drawn about individuals. They contain the district at the block-level, age, gender, and some other information, but neither names nor other personal data. All data is transmitted encrypted.

### Will the data be biased if, for example, more people fill out the questionnaire in densely populated areas?

This geographic bias can be corrected by dividing the number of cases by the total submissions. The resulting percentage or per district is more meaningful.
